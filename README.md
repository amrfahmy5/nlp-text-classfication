# nlp-text-classfication

<p>text classification using a machine learning classification model and and word Embeddings</p>

Task:
 Load review samples (both positive and negative and neutral)
 Generate labels vector for the dataset. 1 for positive review and 0 for negative review and 2 for neutral.
 Sentence embedding based on the average of word embeddings
 Randomly divide data to training and testing sets. 80% for each type (0,1,2)
 Train a classification model with any model of your choice (LR ,LSTM,..)to predict the label of the review

Output
 the accuracy of the model after testing it on the testing set
 allow the user to input a new text review and then predict if it is positive or negative using the trained model
