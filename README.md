# nlp-text-classfication

<p>text classification using a machine learning classification model and and word Embeddings</p>

<h3>Task:</h3>
 Load review samples (both positive and negative and neutral)<br>
 Generate labels vector for the dataset. 1 for positive review and 0 for negative review and 2 for neutral.<br>
 Sentence embedding based on the average of word embeddings.<br>
 Randomly divide data to training and testing sets. 80% for each type (0,1,2) .<br>
 Train a classification model with any model of your choice (LR ,LSTM)to predict the label of the review. <br>

<h3>Output:</h3>
 the accuracy of the model after testing it on the testing set.<br>
 allow the user to input a new text review and then predict if it is positive or negative using the trained model.<br>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
Airlines reviews from annotated tweets. Tweets sentiment are divided to positive ,neutral and negative reviews. <br>
